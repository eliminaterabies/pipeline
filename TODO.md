Clean out old rpcalls

Upgrade or delete SourceFiles() [or not, to simplify Makefile]

Figure out something about new master-ing

make rule to chain through dropbox to make final report (make it in dropbox too)

Clarify the two incubation scripts (and the two uses of convertDay)

Consider privatizing the repo while people are learning to use it.

Fix the .script file
* Eventually, automate this
