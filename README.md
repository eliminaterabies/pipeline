## Ground rules

This is a _public_ repo; make sure that linked data sources are secure and that outputs are always to directories that are Ignore-d.

## Data linkage

You will need to have access to data files in a Dropbox. The default location of this Dropbox is ~/Dropbox/Rabies_TZ/. If your data is elsewhere (or if you're using a different Dropbox), you will need to either set up links, or make a local configuration file. If `ls ~/Dropbox/Rabies_TZ/Tanzania_Animal*.csv` shows you a bunch of WiseMonkey files, you're probably OK.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
1. Sort out your Data linkage issues (see above)
1. `make dropsetup`
